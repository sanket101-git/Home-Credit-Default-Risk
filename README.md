### Introduction
Home Credit is an international consumer finance provider which operates in 9 countries. It provides point of sales loans, cash loans and revolving loans to underserved borrowers.

Due to poor or nonexistent credit history, a significant portion of the population finds it difficult to have their house loans authorized. This keeps them from being able to purchase the homes of their dreams and occasionally even pushes them to rely on other funding sources that could be unstable and have high-interest rates. On the other hand, choosing which applicants to qualify for housing loans is a significant challenge for banks and other financial lending organizations. Due to the possibility that borrowers with a lengthy credit history could still default on their loan and the possibility that some borrowers with a strong likelihood of repaying their debt may not have a lengthy enough credit history, credit histories are not always an adequate basis for making judgments.

### Business Problem
Home Credit is facing a substantial barrier in providing loans to individuals with insufficient or non-existent credit histories. This challenge hampers the company's mission of broadening financial inclusion and exposes this demographic to exploitation by untrustworthy lenders.
